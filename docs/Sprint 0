# üõ† Sprint 0 Documentation

**Project:** Autonomous Content Generation System
**Sprint Duration:** 1 week (5 working days)
**Sprint Type:** Scaffolding & Environment Setup
**Sprint Goal:** Establish a stable foundation for agent development, orchestrator logic, Supabase integration, and development workflows.

---

## üìå Sprint Objectives

Sprint 0 is focused on:

1. Scaffolding the system architecture
2. Establishing the project structure for agent-based development
3. Deploying the initial infrastructure (frontend, backend, DB)
4. Creating a minimal orchestrator prototype
5. Aligning team standards, naming conventions, and interfaces

This sprint is foundational. It sets up everything future agents and features will rely on.

---

## üß± Key Outcomes

By the end of Sprint 0, we should have:

* ‚úÖ A deployed frontend scaffold on Vercel
* ‚úÖ A working Supabase project with schemas and auth
* ‚úÖ A Pocketbase Flow environment for agent orchestration
* ‚úÖ A functional task runner to trigger agent stubs
* ‚úÖ Codex agent dev environments configured
* ‚úÖ Shared `schemas` and `utils` libraries
* ‚úÖ Sample content record with pipeline-ready data

## üß™ Deliverables

* `README.md`: Environment setup, database bootstrapping, dev flow
* `Agents.md`: Full agent dev protocol
* `schemas.py` / `schemas.ts`: Centralized I/O and DB types
* `seo-agent`: First stub + test harness + sample input/output
* `orchestrator.py`: Initial task manager and executor
* `supabase.sql`: DDL file with schema definitions
* Vercel + Supabase project links

---

## üìå Stretch Goals

* Vercel UI renders live status of each agent stage for a sample content piece
* Runbook for local testing + orchestration simulation
* Sample unit test framework for agent code

---

## üß† Notes for Dev Team

* This is a **low-dependency** sprint‚Äîmost work can be done in parallel.
* Follow interface-driven development: stub the contract before implementing logic.
* Don‚Äôt gold-plate the stubs. Focus on I/O shape and wiring first.
* Validate Supabase and Pocketbase work independently *before* trying to connect them.
